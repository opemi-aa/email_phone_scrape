Project Title
Web Scraper Tool

Description
This is a Python tool built to scrape websites and extract email addresses and phone numbers. When the tool is run, it prompts the user for the URL of the website to be scraped, and then it looks through 100 different subdomains as specified in the script after every email address and phone number. It then prints out the 100 subdomain and displays both the email and phone numbers after displaying the result. The tool creates a file for the email and phone numbers and gathers them both in a folder named "scraped_data" in the project directory.
